		I chose to study computer science because I want to be a lifelong learner, and computer science is a constantly changing field.
		This is something I strongly value because learning has been a very rewarding part of my life. 
		I have a continual interest in web development and all things programming because when I'm designing or implementing solutions, time flies! 
		I am very motivated to program every day! 
		You can see what I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/RMertz?tab=repositories">here</a>! As well as more polished work below!
